Multithreaded Chat
Title: Multithreaded Client-Server Chat Application Using Java Sockets

Project Description:
As part of your internship at CODTECH, you will develop a Multithreaded Client-Server Chat Application using Java Sockets. This project will provide hands-on experience with network programming, concurrency, and real-time communication. By successfully completing this project, you will gain practical knowledge in socket programming, multithreading, and inter-process communication, which are essential skills for software developers working on distributed systems and networking applications.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to build a functional chat application that enables multiple clients to communicate in real-time through a centralized server. The server will manage client connections and facilitate message exchange, ensuring seamless and efficient communication.

Key Features:
Client-Server Architecture: Implement a server that listens for incoming client connections and relays messages.

Multithreading: Enable multiple clients to communicate concurrently without delays or interruptions.

Real-Time Communication: Messages from one client should be delivered instantly to other connected clients.

User Identification: Assign unique identifiers to clients to distinguish them in the chat.

Broadcasting & Private Messaging: Allow users to send messages to all connected clients or communicate privately with a specific user.

Thread Synchronization: Use proper synchronization techniques to handle concurrent message transmission.

Server Logging: Maintain logs of user connections and messages exchanged for future reference.

Graceful Disconnection Handling: Ensure that the server properly handles client disconnections without affecting other users.

Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Java

Networking Library: Java Sockets (java.net package)

Concurrency: Java Multithreading (Thread class and Runnable interface)

Development Environment: Any Java-supported IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans

Instructions:
Implement the server to handle multiple client connections using threads.

Develop the client-side application to connect to the server and send/receive messages.

Use synchronized methods or locks to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions.

Ensure a user-friendly interface (optional: implement a GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX).

Properly document the code and project structure for easy understanding and maintenance.

Deliverable:
A fully functional chat application consisting of a server that can handle multiple clients and a client application that allows real-time text-based communication. The project should be well-documented with clear installation and usage instructions.
